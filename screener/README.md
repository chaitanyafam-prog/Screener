# Dysarthria Speech Screening

## Connected therapy tracker

The screener is public and does not require an account. After a result, patients can open the speech therapy tracker's public clinician directory and browse verified clinic listings by city or area. Listings include clinic contact information and an online booking link.

Patients can later create a tracker account, connect with a clinician, receive assigned exercises, submit recordings, and contact the clinic about in-person appointments. The tracker directory is managed by an admin; configure `ADMIN_PASSWORD` in the project `.env` file before using `/admin`. New entries remain private until approved.

On localhost, the tracker link defaults to `http://localhost:5001`. For a public deployment, set `THERAPY_TRACKER_URL` to the deployed tracker's base URL.

A machine learning tool that screens speech recordings for acoustic markers
associated with dysarthria, using classical acoustic/prosodic features
(MFCCs, jitter, shimmer, harmonics-to-noise ratio, formants) and a Support
Vector Machine classifier.

## Important
This is a **screening aid**, not a diagnostic tool. It is intended to flag
speech patterns worth follow-up with a speech-language pathologist — it does
not replace clinical evaluation.

## Data
- [TORGO Database](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~complingweb/data/TORGO/torgo.html) — dysarthric/typical speech from speakers with cerebral palsy and ALS, plus matched controls. Academic use only.
- [UASpeech](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aryashah2k/noise-reduced-uaspeech-dysarthria-dataset) (noise-reduced) — dysarthric/typical speech corpus. CC BY-NC 4.0.

## Method
1. Acoustic features extracted per utterance: 13 MFCCs (+ delta, delta-delta),
   jitter, shimmer, harmonics-to-noise ratio, formants F1/F2, zero-crossing
   rate, RMS energy (85 features total).
2. Classifier: SVM (RBF kernel), trained on combined TORGO + UASpeech data.
3. Evaluated with leave-one-speaker-out cross-validation to test genuine
   speaker-independent generalization (not just in-corpus accuracy).

## Results
| Setup | Accuracy |
|---|---|
| In-corpus (TORGO only, random split) | 94% |
| Speaker-independent (TORGO only, LOGO-CV) | 57–60% |
| Speaker-independent (TORGO + UASpeech, LOGO-CV) | 75% |

Combining corpora for greater speaker diversity substantially improved
genuine generalization to unseen speakers, confirming that speaker-pool
size — not feature or model choice — was the primary bottleneck.

## Limitations
- Both source datasets are restricted to academic/non-commercial use.
- Speaker pool, while improved, is still modest (38 unique speakers).
- Screening only — not validated for diagnostic use.

## Future Work
- Multimodal (audio + video) screening using orofacial motor cues.
- Integration into a broader speech-therapy adherence application with
  exercise-level correctness scoring.

## Reproducing
Training was conducted on Kaggle due to dataset size (9.5GB + 11.5GB).

training pipeline. This repo contains only the exported model artifacts
and inference app.
